I gave an AI all the Tricky songs and this is what it wrote!

lol j/k

This piece has three main components

1. Norns mlr
2. Ieaskul F Mobenthy modular system
3. I did a weed

4 tracks on mlr with a grid

4 modules from the Mobenthy setup

* DENUM
* FOURSES
* SPROTT
* SWOOP 

Output from low pass on SPROTT going live into mlr.

I was imagining the song [Mayor by Pharoahe Monch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q694ps2ZQJo). It's a sort of superhero story about a man who asassinates Rudy Guilani. He was the mayor of New York at the time. He was...not too popular among the people of New York. It has this kind of chaos in the sound production but there's something steady other than the beat. Even though the audience knows the inevitable end of the story.

The SPROTT module has such a cool instability. The pitches are not oscillator frequency but changes to the resonance of the filters in in the module. The string sample in Mayor has a similar instability.

The built in compressor in norns got interesting when I changed the defaults for threashold and make up gain. It has a nice ducking but not full fleged dance music.

The beat is the preset [drumilk.wav in dust](https://github.com/monome/dust/tree/master/audio/tehn) on 0.5 speed.

Compositionally once I got all the clips into mlr I messed with the direction and speed and tempo lock for a few days. I have trouble staying interested in rigid grid locked loop music. Doing a weed before I start gives me a kind of built in off switch. When I start to get too high I know it's time to stop playing. I'll keep the gear on and check back in the morning. If I still like what I hear the track stays. If not I delete everything and start over.
